## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial workspace skeleton with five crates: `sui-id-shared`, `sui-id-store`,
  `sui-id-core`, `sui-id-web`, and `sui-id-bin`.
- SQLite storage layer with bundled SQLite, schema migration runner, and
  per-column XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption for sensitive fields.
- Argon2id password hashing with a minimum-length policy (no composition rules,
  per NIST SP 800-63B guidance).
- Ed25519 (EdDSA) JWT signing implementation with kid-keyed verification.
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Core endpoints:
  - `/.well-known/openid-configuration` (Discovery)
  - `/.well-known/jwks.json` (JWKS, Ed25519 OKP keys)
  - `/oauth2/authorize` (Authorization Code, PKCE S256 mandatory)
  - `/oauth2/token` (`authorization_code` and `refresh_token` grants;
    refresh tokens rotate on each use)
  - `/oauth2/userinfo` (Bearer-authenticated)
- First-run setup flow: master key generation, signing key bootstrap,
  one-time setup token printed to stderr, single-shot create-initial-admin.
- Server-rendered admin UI built on Leptos 0.8 SSR (no WASM bundle):
  setup, login, dashboard, users, clients, audit log.
- Append-only audit log of administrative *and* authentication events
  (`auth.login.success`, `auth.login.failure` with a generic-reason note).
- Per-IP, per-route fixed-window rate limiting on `/admin/login`,
  `/oauth2/token`, and `/setup`. Rejected requests get HTTP 429 with a
  `Retry-After` header.
- `/healthz` health-check endpoint that touches the database but
  intentionally does not leak system state in its response.
- Background GC task that purges expired authorization codes, sessions, and
  refresh tokens every 15 minutes.
- Command-line flags: `--version` / `-V`, `--help` / `-h`,
  `--print-sample-config`, `--config PATH`.
- TOML configuration with validation; master key resolved from env
  (`SUI_ID_MASTER_KEY`) or a separate key file (created `0600` on first
  run).
- Workspace-wide `unsafe_code = "forbid"` and clippy lints.
- 47 unit tests across all crates plus 7 end-to-end integration tests
  covering the full setup → authorize → token → userinfo → refresh-rotation
  flow plus PKCE-mismatch, redirect-URI-mismatch, rate-limit, healthz, and
  GC negative/positive cases.
